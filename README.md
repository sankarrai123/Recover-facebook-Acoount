To recover your old Facebook account, follow the steps below:

Go to your Facebook login page and click on "Forgot your password?" click.

Enter the email address or phone number associated with your account and click Search.

Facebook will then send a password reset link to the email address or phone number associated with your account. Please check your email or phone for the reset link.

Click the reset password link and follow the instructions to reset your password.

Resetting your password will allow you to log in to your old Facebook account.


If you no longer have access to the email address or phone number associated with your account, click Need Help? Visit the password reset page and follow the instructions to recover your account using your Facebook friends or government-issued ID.

How do you open Facebook without a password?

If you forget your Facebook password, you can easily reset it. You can click on "Forgot your account?" click. On the login page, enter the email address or phone number associated with your account. Facebook will then send you a link to reset your password.


Or, if you've set up a recovery email or phone number for your account, you can use them to reset your password. Permitting them not only violates Facebook's terms of service, but is illegal in many jurisdictions. If your account is locked, try the methods above to reset your password.
